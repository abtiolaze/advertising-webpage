  <h2>About the Knives</h2>

  <section class="knife-info">
    <h3>Chef's Knife</h3>
    <p>One of the most frequently used and versatile tools in the kitchen, the chef's knife is typically between eight and ten inches, although it can be as short as six inches and as long as 14 inches. You can probably use your chef's knife for most of your work during food prep, and in many ways, it can be the most important tool you use. The more comfortable you feel with the weight and balance, the more quickly you'll be able to slice, dice, and julienne vegetables during prep for a busy meal service. Therefore it's important to find a knife that gives you a smooth and fast rhythm as you're cutting.</p>

    <h3>Paring Knife</h3>
    <p>A paring knife is basically a mini chef's knife with a small blade that offers greater versatility and precision. While the chef's knife works for cutting hard vegetables, paring knives are great for peeling apples and potatoes, mincing small amounts of garlic and onions, and coring tomatoes. The blade will be no longer than 3.5 inches, so it's ideal for detail work like creating a garnish. A paring knife is useful when you're working with small or tender vegetables and fruit – like ginger, strawberries, garlic, and shallots – but isn't suited for harder vegetables – such as carrots, beets, and squash. Remember that you never want to apply force with a paring knife – so if you find yourself flexing your muscle, swap it out for a heavier blade to avoid injury.</p>

    <h3>Bread Knife</h3>
    <p>The serrated edge of a bread knife lets it slice bread without ruining the crumb structure or tearing the loaf apart. The saw-like blade is ideal when you want to cut something without applying pressure. While a bread knife is great for gently slicing fresh bread, it also works well with soft fruits and vegetables, or ones that have a waxy surface. By using a gentle sawing motion, you can use a serrated knife to effectively cut through the surface of a tomato, orange, or strawberry without crushing the insides, although the cut won't necessarily look as clean as the one you'll get with a chef's knife. Keeping a bread knife sharp can be a challenge because you need a special sharpener in order to sharpen each surface of the jagged blade. However, learning this special skill is worth the effort to maintain a sharp knife.</p>
